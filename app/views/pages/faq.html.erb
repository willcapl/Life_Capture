          <li>Choose a Quiet and Well-Lit Environment:
          Opt for a quiet space with minimal background noise to ensure clear audio and a distraction-free recording. Natural light is ideal, so position yourself facing a window or use soft, diffused lighting to illuminate your face.
          Good lighting enhances video quality and makes your expressions more visible.
          </li>

          <li> Can everyone see you properly?
          Make sure you are in focus.
          Not too close or too far away, let us see you in all your glory, an arms length away from the camera can be a good rule to folow.
          </li>

          <li>
          Audio Considerations:
          External Microphone: If possible, use an external microphone for better audio quality. Good audio is equally important as video quality.
          Minimize Background Noise: Choose a quiet location to minimize background noise. Avoid shooting in areas with heavy traffic, machinery, or other sources of disturbance.
          </li>
          <li>
          Remember practice makes perfect, don't be afraid to experiment by doing a few test videos, Familiarize yourself with your equipment, and don't hesitate to try different techniques to find what works best for your specific situation.
