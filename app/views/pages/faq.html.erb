          Opt for a quiet space with minimal background noise to ensure clear audio and a distraction-free recording. Natural light is ideal, so position yourself facing a window or use soft, diffused lighting to illuminate your face.
          Good lighting enhances video quality and makes your expressions more visible.</li>

          Make sure you are in focus.

          Audio Considerations:
          External Microphone: If possible, use an external microphone for better audio quality. Good audio is equally important as video quality.
          Minimize Background Noise: Choose a quiet location to minimize background noise. Avoid shooting in areas with heavy traffic, machinery, or other sources of disturbance.

          <li>
          Remember practice makes perfect, don't be afraid to experiment by doing a few test videos, Familiarize yourself with your equipment, and don't hesitate to try different techniques to find what works best for your specific situation.
